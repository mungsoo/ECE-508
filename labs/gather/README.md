## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with the gather pattern.

## Instructions

In the provided source code you will find a function named `s2g_gpu_gather`.
Complete the function to call the `s2g_gpu_gather_kernel` kernel which will implement the gather pattern.
This will be done in a similar fashion to the scatter pattern you implemented previously.

Use the helper functions `outInvariant(...)` and `outDependent(...)` appropriately.

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.
